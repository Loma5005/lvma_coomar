<h1>Our Mission</h1>

The mission of eMobilis Training Institute is to create opportunities for African youth by training them on digital, software and technological skits. This prepares them for the future of work by equipping them with marketable, industry driven skills.

Our goal is to ensure that our talented youth are available and trained in order to meet the growing opportunities and needs of the ICT Industry in Africa.

We also envision an explosion of technology innovation and the creation of successful tech ventures by local developers from across the country with a zeal for changing the world through harnessing the power of their technology training for social good.


<h1>Our Vision</h1>

Our vision at eMobilis is to empower Kenyan youth to tap into the myriad opportunities that the mobile, technology and software development industry offers so that they can innovate, create and improve their situation in life through use of digital tools.

Given the global predictions that the digital economy will continue to grow exponentially throughout Africa, and especially in Kenya, eMobilis Technology Training Institute is a catalyst to enable Africans from all walks of life to benefit from this social/economic revolutionâ€”not just in greater access of information, but also in leading design and content development. We hope our efforts will stimulate economic growth and empower African youth.
